# Uses

This is a list of stuff I use, that you might be interested in.
I "try" to keep this up-to-date.

## Software

I'm (naturally) a Linux user, but I'm impartial to BSD as well. I'm currently
using [Void Linux](https://voidlinux.org), mainly for its stable
rolling-release nature, but also the simplicity. The Void package repository
is also quite easy to contribute to, so most software is available, at least
in my case. In the rare case where I can't find something, I normally resort
to using [Nix](https://nixos.org/) instead, which works suprisingly well.

Other things I use, and highly recommend:

- [Kakoune](https://kakoune.org) for code editing, pairing quite nicely with
[sidetree](https://github.com/topisani/sidetree)

- [zsh](https://www.zsh.org) as my primary shell
- [Sway](https://swaywm.org/) window manager
- [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) terminal emulator

## Hardware

I use some *weird* pieces of hardware, or at least some unexpected ones.

- Acer Aspire 3 Spin 14 laptop - the only computer I really use, very much
    not designed for some of the stuff I do, but it's (relatively) cheap.

- Microsoft IntelliMouse Explorer 3.0 - certainly my favourite mouse, I
    wouldn't really consider using anything else. Shame it was made ~20
    years ago now.

- Sony WH-CH700N headphones - got them a couple of years back for the
    bargain price of £25. Despite being made back in 2018, they aren't
    too bad for today (in my opinion).

- Various Apple iPods, all flash-modded and repaired, some using
    [Rockbox](https://www.rockbox.org).

- A jailbroken Amazon Kindle Paperwhite 3, that
[I compiled Vim for](https://bsky.app/profile/nathanjgill.uk/post/3m6two7n4v222).

- Sony Walkman D-E220 portable CD player, probably one of the best value
    purchases I've ever made, for just £12.
