# About Me

I'm a college student in the UK, studying computer science, mathematics, and
physics. Though that's probably not the part you care about.

# Programming

I'm pretty interested in programming, particuarly in systems level areas,
but I enjoy a mix of stuff. I'm a contributor to various open-source projects,
and have a few of my own. Here's a couple of those:

- [tlockr](https://github.com/OldUser101/tlockr), a (experimental) customisable
    screen locker for wlroots compositors. The main idea is that is uses user
    defined QML to render any password prompt.

- [nlock](https://github.com/OldUser101/nlock), a stable alternative to tlockr
    that's in early stages. It's basically tlockr with my favourite theme built
    in, rendered with Cairo.

- [tars](https://github.com/OldUser101/tars), the static site generator that
    powers this website. It's written in Rust, and uses Jinja (or compatible
    at least) templates.

My favourite programming language is C, but again, I quite enjoy writing Rust,
C++, and (somewhat suprisingly) Python too.

# Operating System, Software Packages

I'm (naturally) a Linux user, but I'm impartial to BSD as well. I'm currently
using [Void Linux](https://voidlinux.org), mainly for its stable
rolling-release nature, but also the simplicity. The Void package repository
is also quite easy to contribute to, so most software is available, at least
in my case. In the rare case where I can't find something, I normally resort
to using [Nix](https://nixos.org/) instead, which works suprisingly well.

Other things I use, and highly recommend:

- [Kakoune](https://kakoune.org) for code editing, pairing quite nicely with
[sidetree](https://github.com/topisani/sidetree)

- [zsh](https://www.zsh.org) as my primary shell
- [Sway](https://swaywm.org/) window manager
- [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) terminal emulator

# Systemetric

I am part of Hills Road Robotics (a.k.a. team Systemetric). Here's the
[GitHub organisation](https://github.com/systemetric). Alongside my own
projects, I am often building/maintaining others here.

As part of this, I help with [RoboCon](https://robocon.uk), a competition we
run for GCSE students in the UK. Our team also competes in [Student Robotics](https://srobo.org)
which I am involved in (at least in 2025).

You can find more stuff relating to my role in this in [my blog](/blog/index.html)
where I may post updates occasionally.

# Other

Given the name, this section is other stuff that doesn't fit nicely with any
of the categories above.

- I enjoy modding Apple iPods, I've currently got a 6th-gen Classic with a 128 GB
    mSATA drive, hoping to upgrade to SD at some point, and also a 1st-gen
    Mini, with a 32 GB CF card, running [Rockbox](https://www.rockbox.org/).

- My favourite computer mouse is the Microsoft IntelliMouse Explorer 3.0.

- My favourite laptop is the HP EliteBook 8460p, it's probably the most reliable
    and repairable hardware I've ever used. I don't use it a great deal however.

- My favourite book series is easily Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. If you
    (somehow) haven't read it, then I highly recommend you do.

My GitHub username is [OldUser101](https://github.com/OldUser101) and, as I say
over there, you can pronounce my username in a few ways:

- "Old user one-oh-one"
- "Old user five"
- "Old user minus three"

Take your pick.
