# Contact

You can find me in various places on the Internet, here's a list of them:

- E-mail: [nathan@nathanjgill.uk](mailto:nathan@nathanjgill.uk),
    [nathan.j.gill@outlook.com](mailto:nathan.j.gill@outlook.com)
- Website: [nathanjgill.uk](https://nathanjgill.uk), you're already here.
- GitHub: [@OldUser101](https://github.com/OldUser101)
- Bluesky: [@nathanjgill.uk](https://bsky.app/profile/nathanjgill.uk)
- Matrix: @olduser101:matrix.org
- LinkedIn: [in/nathan-gill-olduser101](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathan-gill-olduser101)

A vCard with all of these is available [here](/static/nathan-gill-vcard.vcf).

Generally, if you want to have a converstaion, e-mail will probably get you a
response the quickest.

I don't really care which e-mail address you use. Ideally, the second one
would've been private, but I had already used it for signing Git commits,
so it's public now.

You can tell if a profile is mine if it has the name "OldUser101", or a
variation of it, sometimes with underscores. It's likely it will have my
blue gradient avatar too, which is the favicon for this page, and shown below.
