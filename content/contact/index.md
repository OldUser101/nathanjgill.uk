# Contact

You can find me in various places on the Internet, here's a list of them:

- E-mail: [nathan@nathanjgill.uk](mailto:nathan@nathanjgill.uk),
    [nathan.j.gill@outlook.com](mailto:nathan.j.gill@outlook.com)
- Website: [nathanjgill.uk](https://nathanjgill.uk), you're already here.
- GitHub: [@OldUser101](https://github.com/OldUser101)
- Bluesky: [@nathanjgill.uk](https://bsky.app/profile/nathanjgill.uk)
- Matrix: @olduser101:matrix.org
- LinkedIn: [in/nathan-gill-olduser101](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathan-gill-olduser101)

A vCard with all of these is available [here](/static/nathan-gill-vcard.vcf).

Generally, if you want to have a converstaion, e-mail will probably get you a
response the quickest.

I don't really care which e-mail address you use. Ideally, the second one
would've been private, but I had already used it for signing Git commits,
so it's public now.

You can tell if a profile is mine if it has the name "OldUser101", or a
variation of it, sometimes with underscores. It's likely it will have my
blue gradient avatar too, which is the favicon for this page, and shown below.

# Social Media

I don't really produce content for social media, mainly because I can't be
bothered, and don't really see the point. I also don't want some random
Internet guy knowing my entire life story, even if I've forgotten parts
myself.

Typically, I also don't feel like *being* that random Internet
guy who knows someone's entire life story, so it's rare to find me using
such platforms at all.

In general, I only use social media services that are centered around
private chats. Even then, I don't use them a great deal.
Bluesky is an exception to this, I have an account, but I rarely
post any real content.

Don't bother asking me for social media profiles outside the ones listed above.
The liklihood is, they don't exist.
