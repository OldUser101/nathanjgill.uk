# Programming

I'm working on several things at the moment. Most namely:

- [nlock](https://github.com/OldUser101/nlock), a Wayland screen locker that
    I may be writing specifically because I was annoyed that there was nothing
    that looked like [my favourite SDDM theme](https://github.com/stepanzubkov/where-is-my-sddm-theme).
    I aim to make this relatively customisable too, if I can implement the
    rendering properly with Cairo.

- [tars](https://github.com/OldUser101/tars), the static site generator that
    powers the website you are currently viewing. Currently working on
    implementing plugins, which should make it more extensible, with things
    like (hopefully) RSS for blog posts, and automatic sitemap generation.

- My A-level computer science NEA project. I don't really know if there's a
    name for it, but a tool that tracks "dependencies" between source files? I
    thought of "dependency analyser", but that implies something else. I also
    don't really know how useful it will be.
