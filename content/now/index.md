# Programming

I'm working on several things at the moment. Most namely:

- [tars](https://github.com/OldUser101/tars), the static site generator that
    powers the website you are currently viewing. Currently working on
    implementing plugins, which should make it more extensible, with things
    like (hopefully) RSS for blog posts, and automatic sitemap generation.

- Building parts of [Tetra Linux](https://github.com/tetra-linux), most
    importantly, the package manager. I previously had it written in shell
    script, but I'm now moving it to Rust, because of POSIX shell limitations.

- My A-level computer science NEA project. I don't really know if there's a
    name for it, but a tool that tracks "dependencies" between source files? I
    thought of "dependency analyser", but that implies something else. I also
    don't really know how useful it will be.

- Attempting to learn the [Zig programming language](https://ziglang.org).

# Other Things

- Trying to learn to touch type properly, as well as learning the more
    ergonomic Colemak-DH keyboard layout.

- Writing content for this website.
